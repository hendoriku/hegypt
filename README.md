**Hegypt** is a web application designed to tackle one of the biggest challenges in AI interaction: **crafting the perfect prompt**. This application acts as your personal assistant, guiding you through a structured form to design, save, manage, and reuse ideal prompts for various technical and creative needs.

This project is a complete solution, from brainstorming a prompt in a local environment to making it accessible over the network with a custom domain via a reverse proxy.
